    <h1><b> 15 Rules to follow when camping</b></h1>

    <div class="extradesc">
        <p> Camping is a wonderful opportunity to get away from a busy life full of traffic, crowds, screens and endless
            input.</p>

        <p>Take a sky full of stars, the smell of a campfire burning, hot dogs on sticks, and add some s'mores -- now
            it's time to relax.</p>

        <p>But an unruly neighbor who talks too loudly, cranks up his or her music and allows the kids or pets to run
            wild will ruin a relaxing afternoon for everyone in the campground.</p>

        <p>Some people seem to forget that they're not alone in the campground and that makes other campers
            uncomfortable. </p>

        <p>Having fun and being a good neighbor can go hand-in-hand in a campground, as long as people follow these
            basic campground etiquette rules.</p>

    <h2><b> 1. Respect nature.</b></h2>

    <div>
        <p>All campers, whether they're traveling
            in a 40-foot motor coach or riding a
            motorcycle and staying in a pup </p>
        <p> tent,
            have to respect nature. That doesn't mean
            simply enjoying the beautiful views.
            It's also about being
        <p></p>p> mindful of the impact visiting has on these places.
        Never interact with wildlife, don't dig up any plants or trees and never
        cut down any live trees for firewood. Mind every step that's taken and avoid damaging precious habitats.</p>
